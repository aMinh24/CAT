  cat:
  - Hello there! Look at which cat is here.
  - Seems like you've also escaped from confinement like me, huh? It's really cramped
    in there, I don't like it.
  - They feed us dirty stuff. Many cats are forced to stay in a tightly packed cage.
  - Be careful, wandering like this could easily get you caught and put back in there.
  - Since escaping the cage, I haven't been able to find a way out of this eerie
    place.
  - If you find a way out, please take me with you.
